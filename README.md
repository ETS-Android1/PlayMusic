## The Journey of making Play Music Android App

Hello there, I am Nalinikanta an Aspiring Android Developer learning at Masai School. You might have used the Play Music Android App, which is Indiaâ€™s first hyper-local music platform that enables an good user experience.

Moving ahead, we team Ethane developed a clone of the App of Play Music in just 5 days as a part of our curriculum. This blog is all about our journey and the challenges we faced while building the project.

The Team Members are:
1. Nalinikanta Ojha
2. Arya Devi V
3. Nimit Agarwal


**A little about the teammates and their contributions.**
I canâ€™t thank Arya Devi V and Nimit Agarwal enough, who worked hard for this project to become what it is today. I think the best way to thank them would be to mention their contribution and let their work speak for them.

Arya Devi V was responsible for  Video Fragment, API calls, Music and Video Player Activities, integrating the blog with our app, I also partnered with all three of them to work on the UI part and connecting the screens.
Nimith was responsible for the settings page, bottom Navigation and the search box. These works improve app functionalities.
In the mean time, handled the  the Home Fragment and Favourite Fragment. He took care of all recycler view, firebase, and Retrofit things such as making the pages that took user experience to the next level. He used to merge all our codes at night and was tracking the progress of us all.
Though this project was not a piece of cake. I loved to work with these amazing guys during this 5 days journey we got lots of learnings and got a broader perspective about the application lifecycle.
